You are a senior frontend architect and product engineer.

Your task is to adapt an existing frontend UI template (keep all colors, layout, typography, spacing, animations, and visual identity unchanged) into a Basketball Performance Analysis Web Application.

⚠️ Do NOT redesign the UI.
⚠️ Do NOT change the color theme or component styling.
Your work is content mapping, page structure, features, and frontend logic only.

🎯 Product Overview

The system is an AI-powered basketball analytics platform that supports two user account types:

Team / Organization Account

Personal Player Account

Both account types share the same UI components but see different content, pages, and features based on role.

🧩 Frontend Architecture Requirements
1️⃣ Global App Structure

SPA architecture (React / Next.js / Vue — use existing stack)

Role-based routing

Protected routes (auth required)

Responsive (mobile-first)

2️⃣ Authentication & Account Selection
Pages:

Login

Register

Account Type Selection (Team or Personal)

Logic:

On first registration, user selects:

Team / Organization

Personal Player

Store accountType in auth state

Use accountType to control routing and feature visibility

3️⃣ Navigation & Layout (Do NOT change UI)
Shared Components:

Sidebar

Topbar

Footer

Notifications

Profile Menu

Dynamic Behavior:

Menu items change based on account type

Shared layout, different content

🧠 Frontend Logic Rules

Never show team pages to personal accounts

Never show personal-only analytics to teams

Reuse components wherever possible

Add basketball like photos and animations to the UI where possible.

Design a suitable logo for the application but app name is 'BAKO'.

All analytics data is read-only (backend-driven)

Show loading, processing, and error states

🔌 API Integration (Frontend Side)

Auth service

Video upload service

Analysis status polling

Analytics data fetch

Role-based API calls

DO not Use mock data, if backend endpoints are missing or not implemented just put a placeholder as we wait for end integration.

🧪 UX Behavior Expectations

Clear empty states (e.g. “Upload your first video”)

Status indicators (processing, completed, failed)

Friendly tooltips for non-technical users

Smooth transitions (reuse existing animations)

🧾 Deliverables Expected

Updated page routing structure

Role-based navigation logic

Component reuse map

Placeholder data integration

Clean, scalable folder structure

❌ Explicitly Forbidden

Changing UI colors or theme

Removing existing components

Introducing new design systems

Overengineering animations

✅ Goal

Deliver a production-ready frontend structure that visually matches the original template but functionally supports:

✔ Team-level basketball analysis
✔ Individual player training analysis
✔ African low-resource deployment use cases
