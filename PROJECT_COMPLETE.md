## 🎯 WHAT'S LEFT? (Only Dataset!)

### **Your Task: Record 700-1000 Videos**

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours per day  
**Help:** Get UCU basketball team involved!

**Recording Plan:**
- **Week 1:**
  - Day 1-2: Shooting (100 clips)
  - Day 3-4: Dribbling (100 clips)
  - Day 5-6: Passing (100 clips)
  - Day 7: Defense (100 clips)

- **Week 2:**
  - Day 1-2: Running + Walking (100 clips)
  - Day 3-4: Blocking + Picking (100 clips)
  - Day 5-6: Ball in Hand + Idle (100 clips)
  - Day 7: Quality check & organize

**Then:**
- Week 3: Train VideoMAE → ≥90% accuracy
- Week 4: Final testing & report
